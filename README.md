DPDispatcher is a Python package used to generate HPC (High-Performance Computing) scheduler systems (Slurm/PBS/LSF/Bohrium) jobs input scripts, submit them to HPC systems, and poke until they finish.
â€‹
DPDispatcher will monitor (poke) until these jobs finish and download the results files (if these jobs are running on remote systems connected by SSH).

For more information, check the [documentation](https://dpdispatcher.readthedocs.io/).
