# Running Gaussian 16 with failure allowed

Normally, a task will retry for 3 times if the exit code is not zero. Sometimes, one may allow non-zero code. For example, when running large amounts of Gaussian 16 single point calculation tasks, some of Gaussian 16 tasks may throw SCF errors and return non-zero code. One can append `||:` to the command:

```{literalinclude} ../../examples/task/g16.json
:language: json
:linenos:
```

This ensures the task will always provide zero code.
